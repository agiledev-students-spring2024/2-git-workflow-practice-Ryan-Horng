[AI Technology Like ChatGPT Will Reshape Software Coding Jobs Forever]("https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-ai-technology-end-of-coding-software-developers-jobs-2023-4")

### Analysis

This article brings up many good points regarding the fear of some people have over AI taking over programming jobs. Fundamentally, AI is still a tool that people can use to make their jobs easier and more efficient. The use of AI would make it easier to pump out large amounts of code, but it wouldn't eliminate the human role entirely. It might likely take out a lot of code monkey jobs so the concern may lie there, but overall make the development of software faster. I also sincerely doubt the words of Emad Mostaque in which there would be no programmers in five years. The possibility of that would require that AI be so efficient and perfected that it completely eliminates the need for programmers, which is impossible given the limitations our current AI has. For now, I believe that AI will continue to be used as an efficient tool more than an industry breaker.

### Comment from Robert (Bobby) Impastato

Hi Ryan, I mostly agree with your analysis. With a lot of "code monkey" jobs potentially being replaced, I think AI is mainly a threat to junior developers with little experience, who have, over the last decade, faced a better job market. I think we have a long way to go until AI it truly anywhere close to "breaking" the industry. The demand for software engineers is growing much faster than other jobs, which may balance the potential jobs lost due to greater worker efficiency.
